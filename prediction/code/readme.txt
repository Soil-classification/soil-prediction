Required Dataset 


1.Original Dataset 
	csv new with NPK.csv

2.For doing multiclass class model created a csv file which has re-ordered rows.
	Book3_updated.csv (for fertiliser and crop)
	Book3_updated_soil.csv (for soil)

3.Encoded Numbers contains csv:
	encoded_dict.csv (fertiliser)
	encoded_dict_soil.csv (soil)
	encoded_dict_crop.csv (crop)

4.Upsampled data csv:
	Upsam_soil.csv (soil)
	Upsam_X_fertiliser.csv (fertiliser)
	Upsam_Y_fertiliser.csv (fertiliser)

5.For doing multiclass class model created a csv file which has re-ordered upsampled rows for soil data.
	Book1.csv (soil)

6.Saved RF model For Fertiliser as:
	RfClassifier_Fertilser

7.Saved GBM For Soil as:
	GBMClassifier_Soil

8.Saved RF model For Crop as:
	RfClassifier_Crop

9.A small set of new data for testing the model.
	test_fert_crop_soil.csv
